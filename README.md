# APIDNO

## 📖 Introduction
We propose an adaptive physics-informed DeepONet (API-DONet), a knowledge-guided neural operator network for accurate and adaptive flood forecasting.

## 🧠 Highlights
- Developed a knowledge-guided adaptive deep neural operator networks for flood forecasting.
- Introduced a U-CBAM module to extract spatiotemporal relationships between different channels.
- Designed a Fourier-enhanced network as the decoder to capture global nonlinear behavior.
- Proposed an adversarial training strategy to adaptively balance accuracy and physical consistency.
- Real flood data confirm the improved prediction performance.
